This was my attempt to get a specific type of coordinate for a species off of the DiscoverLife.org page.
Once the species is typed into the search bar, it opens up a little map.
When you click on the map you can see all the coordinates with multiple different labels attached to the bee sighting. 
Here we were only interested in those marked AMNH_BEES.....
Instead of doing all this manually I used to R to read the html document, process the information and export it into an excel file so that I could simply copy and paste into the existing spreadsheet.

I would like to eventually add loops so that the code can search the website on its own and export an excel document with the species name on the end.
